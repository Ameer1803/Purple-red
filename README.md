# Purple & Red

Purple & Red alpha ver. 2.0

Controls are basic WASD movement keys, IT DOES GO RIGHT AND LEFT, the issue is the camera goes along with it, need to give a way to show sideways movement happening.
No graphics required to be downloaded but font has to be downloaded, available in the repository, adjust the path name for the font in the code before playing.

issues to be resolved eventually:
-apply box camera
-Not theoretically infinite
-graphics and animations
-music and sound effects

Update 1: solved right and left movement visibility, need to look into smoother enemy movement when it reaches terminal velocity
